        "Creating a NN model is slightly different from the normal process that we are used to in sklearn. We need to do a little more work to set it up. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Create Model and Add Layers\n",
        "\n",
        "First we need to make a NN model, it comes \"empty\". We will use a sequential model, which is the most simple type but is less configurable (which we don't care about much right now). The limitation of sequential models is that they can only take in one tensor and only output one tensor. The other options here are \"functional\", which allows for the structure of the model to be configured, and \"model subclassing\", which allows you to build almost everything from scratch. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Layers\n",
        "\n",
        "Next we need to add some layers. We will start simple with only two \"thinking\" layers, and one to do some processing. We can think of the layers roughly like steps of the sklearn pipeline, with data entering at the first layer and predictions flowing out of the final layer. \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to \"normal\" neural network layers, there are many other types that can do all kinds of other stuff. One example we will use here is the normalization one at the front. This layer does exactly what you'd expect - it normalizes our data so the rest of the network can use it. The normalize layer will also automatically handle the 2D nature of the data that we are used to, so we don't need to worry about that aspect here. Other layers can do everything from regularization to image processing, they are also commonly inhierited for developers to create custom layers targeting specific tasks. We'll use a few of the other ones as we move through things. \n",

        "#### Dense Layers\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use dense layers here. When adding the layer we need to specify a couple of things. One is the input dimensions - we need to tell the network what the shape of the incomming data is. \n",

        "The other argument is the units, which represents the output dimension. When using these Keras dense layers we don't need to specify each layer's input/output like we did when we made it by hand. We specify both, using units and input_dim, for the first layer that takes in the input; for subsequent layers we can just specify the output and Keras will automatically figure the rest out. \n",
        "\n",
        "Note that there is also an input layer that can be added, we can avoid the need for it by using the input_dim or input_shape as shown below. The two examples there do the same thing, since the input is flat - 18 features. If we are dealing with inputs that do not start out as flat, such as in an image, use the input_shape since you can specify all dimensions; we will see an example of this next time with some images. \n",

The validation loss will usually somewhat mirror the training loss, except it will often reach a minimum at some point before again increasing.

        "## Basics of Overfitting and Underfitting in Neural Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like any other type of model, our primary task in trying to attain an accurate set of predictions is to balance the overfitting and underfitting. In a neural network, the ideas are the same as with standard models, however the tools and their usage can differ slightly. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Add Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Adding data to the training set is the number one way to improve accuracy. As noted above, neural networks are commonly able to acheive very high accuracy levels if provided with very large training sets. For smaller datasets, the probability of a neural network being the best model is much lower than with big data. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Capacity\n",
        "\n",
        "The model capacity is the \"size\" of the model - refering to the combination of the number of neurons on each layer and the number of layers. \n",
        "\n",
        "In general the larger a feature set is, the larger a capacity we will need to be able to avoid underfitting and make accurate predictions. However, similar to a decision tree, if the model becomes too large for the data, we are likely to overfit. \n",
        "\n",
        "In big data scenarios (e.g. Google or Tesla training image recognition models) the feature sets can be massive (e.g. a 5 megapixel image is at least 15 million features) so the networks used have a very high capacity. Because there is a lot of training data, the model is able to have a huge capacity, but not overfit. These models can take FOREVER to process (e.g. weeks with the work paralellized on dedicated and fast machines) but they are able to make very accurate predictions since they get all the \"benefits\" of overfitting - predictions highly tailored to the training data; along with all the \"benefits\" of underfitting - since there is so much training data, they are still generalized enough to predict new data. \n",
        "\n",
        "The combination of large datasets, deep networks, and fast processing allows for most of the modern AI that we see or interact with. "

        "\n",
        "Early stopping is very common with neural networks, due to the common pattern mentioned above of the optimal balance of over/under fitting occuring at some point within many, potentially thousands, of epochs. Early stopping kills the process after it detects that validation loss is going back up. \n",
        "\n",
        "We can put early stopping in place by using a Keras function called a callback, which has odd syntax, but is quite simple to use. The patience pararmeter controls how many epcohs of worsening scores are tolerated before implementing the stop. The restore_best_weights tells the model to roll back all of its weights to the optimal point - so we automatically get the best model post-training. \n",
        "\n",
        "In most cases we probabyl want to use early stopping along with a high epoch number. We can let the model train, and just tell us when it is finished. "

        "Neural networks also commonly employ a technique call dropouts to prevent overfitting. This works just like the name says, every time the data is moved from one layer to another some portion of the features are randomly held out from being used. \n",
        "\n",
        "The intuitive explanation for dropout is that because individual nodes in the network cannot rely on the output of the others, each node must output features that are useful on their own. This sounds somewhat weird, but is actually effective. The number of features held out is called the dropout rate, typically between .2 and .5. \n",
        "\n",
        "An analogy can be drawn to the bootstrapping we looked at with trees - some random subset of features is selected each time, resulting in each batch getting \"a slightly different look at the data\", thus preventing overfitting. "

Being off in one direction is bad, being off in the other direction can cause you to \"fall off of a cliff\" so to speak.
