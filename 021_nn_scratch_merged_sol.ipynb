Here they are initialized to a random bumber, in practice these are initialized using some smart method, configurable with a parameter. Each neuron connects to each other neuron, so there is a wight for each of those connections - a matrix of input size by output size. Each output has one bias value. \n",

The calculation itself is a dot product - which multiplies each input by its corresponding weight in the matrix automatically. This could be done by lots of loops, but this is more compact and efficient. Recall that each connection has a weight, so we end up with this large matrix. \n",
    "<li> Backward Propagation: this layer calculates the impact of the error stemming from each input X. This is done by calculating the gradient of the loss with respect to each input - thus allowing us to attribute portions of the output error to the different inputs.

    "\n",
    "Next we do the back propagation, this takes that error with respect to y that we figured out, and \"breaks\" that error down into error with respect to each term from the previous layer. Recall that one neuron creates a prediction (during FP) that is equal to w1*x1 + w2*x2 +... b; this does a sort of reverse execution of that - starting with the overall error and mapping it to each term. The error is effectively split into parts and each of the m*x terms and the b term is labeled as being accountable for some of it. Since the x values are the inputs, they can't change, so we modify the weights and bias to lessen the error - this is the gradient descent part. This gets repeated back through each layer until the first layer, then another FP begins with the new weights. The learning rate controls the size of the adjustments. \n",
    "\n",
    "This back propagation part is the key to the high accuracy ceiling that neural networks have when the data is large - we can tune each of many neurons specifically to their contribution of error. If we have enough data, we can get very accurate predictions. "
